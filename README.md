This is my main TF2 hud!

This is an edited old version of Flaw Hud dated in 2020.

**I did not create this Hud! [Russ](https://steamcommunity.com/id/RussTF2) created it for me and I thought it would be okay to upload this for anyone is interested.**

**12/31/2024 - HUD IS BEING WORKED ON RIGHT NOW!**

  

## WHAT THE HUD CONTAINS
>-Ripped sounds and files from previous Guilty Gear Games (Xrd, XX, Overture, Strive)

>-Static crosshair that can be edited in the Hud files. Search for "crosshair.cfg or edit "hudlayout.res"! Delete THE "crosshair.cfg" if thats bothering you.




Your default meter for weapons is ripped from Guilty Gear Xrd's "Tension" meter. 

Your secondary meter is ripped from Guilty Gear 2 Overture Sol Badguy's health bar.

Sadly, third meter is not custom because it would cover too much space on the screen. The meter is just a small white bar. 

Clicking around the TF2 menu will play Guilty Gear XX confirm sound effect. 

Clicking on the title "Junkyard-Dog Hud" will play an audio of Sol Badguy saying and using Gun flame. 

Custom background is Paris from Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R. 

Custom Font on the menu and meters are from Guilty Gear Strive.

## Versions


>Version 1 = White numbers with black outline for ammo and health. Fits close to Strive's combo font.

>Version 1.1 = Same thing but no Sol sprite on the side.
## Stuff that needs to be fixed.

-Confirm sound effect needs to be a .wav! When loading into a Highlander match, it plays a loud scratching sound.

-The title "TEAM FORTRESS 2" is still being shown on the main menu when the player is in a server.

**All these errors are in v1 and v1.1! It is going to be fixed in v2.**
