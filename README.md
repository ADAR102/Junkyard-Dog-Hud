This is my main TF2 hud!

This is an edited old version of Flaw Hud dated in 2020.

**I did not create this Hud! [Russ](https://steamcommunity.com/id/RussTF2) created it for me and I thought it would be okay to upload this for anyone is interested.**

  

## WHAT THE HUD CONTAINS
>-Ripped sounds and files from previous Guilty Gear Games (Xrd, XX, Overture, Strive)

>-Static Ambassador crosshair that can be edited in the Hud files. Search for "crosshair.cfg." To learn more on the static Ambassador crosshair mod, [click here!](https://github.com/jooonior/tf2-static-ambassador-crosshair) IF THE MOD IS BOTHERING YOU, JUST SIMPLY DELETE THE "crosshair.cfg" FILE!

  

Your default meter for weapons is using the Xrd "Tension" meter. 

Your secondary meter is ripped from Guilty Gear 2 Overture Sol Badguy's health bar.

Sadly, third meter is not custom because it would cover too much space on the screen. The meter is just a small white bar. 

Clicking around the TF2 menu will play Guilty Gear XX confirm sound effect. 

Clicking on the title "Junkyard-Dog Hud" will play an audio of Sol Badguy saying and using Gun flame. 

Custom background is Paris from Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R. 

Custom Font on the menu and meters are from Guilty Gear Strive.
