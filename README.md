# Junkyard-Dog-Hud
/// Thank you for downloading Junkyard-Dog Hud!\\\ 

  

  

This is a Guilty Gear themed mod. I play TF2 spy, and I made sure this fits nicely for me while I play. 

Russ created this Hud as a Christmas present! It is an old version of Flaw Hud dated 2020. I really like the old version of Flaw Hud, but I never had my own Hud until 

now (12/18/2024) 

  

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EDIT THE HUD!!! I AM JUST SHARING THIS INCASE IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED TO HAVING MY VERY OWN HUD!!! 

  

/// WHAT THE HUD CONTAINS \\\ 

  

-Ripped sounds and files from previous Guilty Gear Games (Xrd, XX, Overture, Strive) 

-Static Ambassador crosshair that can be edited in the Hud files. Search for "crosshair.cfg." To learn more on the static Ambassador crosshair mod, checkout https://github.com/jooonior/tf2-static-ambassador-crosshair IF THE MOD IS BOTHERING YOU, JUST SIMPLY DELETE THE "crosshair.cfg" FILE! 

  

Your default meter for weapons is using the Xrd tension meter. 

Your secondary meter is ripped from Guilty Gear 2 Overture Sol Badguy's meter. 

Sadly, third meter is not custom because it would cover too much space on the screen. 

  

Clicking around the TF2 menu will play Guilty Gear XX confirm sound effect. 

Clicking on the title "Junkyard-Dog Hud" will play an audio of Sol Badguy saying and using Gun flame. 

Custom background is Paris from Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R. 

Custom Font on the menu and meters are from Guilty Gear Strive. 

Custom image replacing Team Fortress 2 above the menu. It shows Order-Sol face smirking at Sol Bad guy's sword from Xrd (Junkyard Dog). 

Darker background for some sections in the TF2 menu. 

  

/// Versions \\\ 

  

Version 1 = The hud with the old numbers for ammo and health. It also comes with Sol Badguy sprite from Guilty Gear XX series reacting to the player's health. 

  

When the player overheals, Sol Bad guy sprite does a Dragon Install. 

When the player is low health, Sol Bad guy Sprite is on his knees with a headache. 

  

  

IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SOL BADGUY SPRITE THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE THE "NO SOL SPRITE" 

  

Version 2 = Replaces the numbers for ammo and health. The font is ripped from Guilty Gear Xrd series.
